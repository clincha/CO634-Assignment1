# CO634-Assignment1
This was a project for my final year of university. We were tasked with creating an modular exponentiation function that worked in under 10 seconds (for the values given).

### Exercise 
Write a Java class that takes three space-separated arguments a, j, n passed as command-line parameters all non-negative values of type long, and writes to standard output the value a^j mod n.
Important: You are to use no libraries, APIs, or any resources outside of standard Java libraries. 
You cannot use class BigInteger, nor class Math.
Important: You are to use no source, living or dead (other than the notes/slides). 
No textbooks, papers, Internet, and especially no other people.
